# Bus Reservation System

**Description:** This is a Bus Reservation System programmed using C.This program allows us to add bus details,then we can reserve a bus seat according to vacant seat available.One can check for list for vacant seats in a bus.It also allows us to see the available bus for now. This is a simple implementation of C code.

These are the following features of the system:

-> Login System

-> Book Tickets

-> Cancel Booking

-> View Bus Status

User can display the bus schedule, book tickets, cancel reservations, and check the bus status board using this system.

To run this bus ticket reservation system in c, we need to make sure that we have a Code Blocks or any platform of C installed in our computer.
